## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
Weigelt_prod.lp <- make.lp(11,9)

#using function max

set.objfn(Weigelt_prod.lp, c(420,360,300,420,360,300,420,360,300))
lp.control(Weigelt_prod.lp, sense='max')

# available storage space

set.row(Weigelt_prod.lp, 1, c(20,15,12), indices = c(1,2,3))
set.row (Weigelt_prod.lp, 2, c(20,15,12), indices = c(4,5,6))
set.row(Weigelt_prod.lp,3, c(20,15,12), indices = c(7,8,9))

# Plants excess capacity

set.row(Weigelt_prod.lp, 4, c(1,1,1), indices = c(1,2,3))
set.row(Weigelt_prod.lp, 5, c(1,1,1), indices = c(4,5,6))
set.row(Weigelt_prod.lp,6, c(1,1,1), indices = c(7,8,9))
