## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
chooseCRANmirror(graphics = getOption("menu.graphics"), ind = 79,
                 local.only = FALSE)
install.packages("vcd")
airlines <- read.csv("USAirlines.csv")




#summary of the dataset US Airlines

summary(airlines)



# mean of the firm from the dataset Airlines
mean(airlines$firm)

#median of the firm from the dataset Airlines
median(airlines$firm)

#mode of the firm from the dataset Airlines
mode(airlines$firm)

#install the package dplyr
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
select(airlines, firm : cost)
filter(airlines, firm ==1)


summary(airlines)
```


```{r}
plot(airlines$year, airlines$cost)
```

##Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
